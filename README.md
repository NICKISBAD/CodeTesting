# Hello!
 ## I'm NICKISBAD, more formally: Nick or Jiver (preferably Jiver please :P) This is my codetesting repostitory. Where i test different code and languages.

# List of things i've uploaded here: **(as of 25/6/23)**

## Most of these are originally made on [Replit](https://replit.com/~)

* **MathMachine** -- A piece of code made purely to help with maths. It can divide, add, subtract, etc and have multiple numbers! (Originally uploaded on [Replit](https://replit.com/@JiverNot/Math-Machine-20?v=1). )
 
+ **Robot-ify** -- Another piece of code that makes your text robotic with symbols and odd, randomized capitalization (Originally uploaded on [Replit](https://replit.com/@JiverNot/Robot-ify?v=1).)

- **Small Textifier** -- A luascript that makes your text impossibly small, useful for whatever you need small text for (Originally uploaded on [Replit](https://replit.com/@JiverNot/SmallTextifier?v=1))

- **Counter** -- Luascript that counts to your desired number with a delay (delay can be turned off). Is mainly for misc use (Originally uploaded on [Replit](https://replit.com/@JiverNot/Counter?v=1))

- **Dice Roll** -- Luascript that rolls a dice in whatever requirements you want (Number of rolls, and dice sides) Occasionally reads numbers wrong (Originally uploaded on [Replit](https://replit.com/@JiverNot/Nicks-Sub-Standard-Dice-Roll?v=1))

- **P-Gen (Password Generator)** -- SLIGHTLY more advanced luascript that uses a set of characters and a desired length to create a (maybe) secure password. (Originally uploaded on [Replit](https://replit.com/@JiverNot/PasswordGenerator?v=1))

**more to come**
